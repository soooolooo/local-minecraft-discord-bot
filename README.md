# My local minecraft discord bot

**What the story behind this discord bot?**

I wanted to create my own discord bot. I found out it is possible by following up the tutorials of CodeLyon's on YouTube.
I introduced the idea of creating a discord bot to show my own minecraft server status. My friends accepted that idea. Thus, I created one.
Made with discord.js library of node.js.

**I noticed the bot will only give updates for local server (127.0.0.1), can I change the IP to any minecraft server I wish?**
Yes.

**You made it in node.js, but we can't see "node-modules" folder**

I assume this folder should be ready on your side. Thanks.
